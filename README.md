<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
An AI-powered app called the "HealthCare Vision Assistant" uses image recognition to evaluate food, fruits, or beverages and offers tailored health recommendations based on the user's medical condition. To provide intelligent dietary recommendations, it integrates natural language processing and computer vision.

<h2><b>Objectives</b></h2>
This project uses AI-powered vision and natural language models to help users determine whether the foods they choose are in line with their health conditions.
Through the analysis of both textual and visual input, the system provides insightful information about health.

<h2><b>Features</b></h2>

Upload an image of food, fruit, or a drink for analysis.

Enter your current health condition or medical concern.

AI analyzes whether the uploaded item is suitable for your condition.

Provides detailed and reason-based health recommendations.

Simple web-based interface built using Streamlit.

<h2><b>Technologies Used</b></h2>

Python

Streamlit ‚Äì for the user interface

LangChain ‚Äì for prompt handling and retrieval-augmented generation

OpenAI GPT-4o ‚Äì for text analysis and contextual reasoning

NVIDIA Vision Model (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct) ‚Äì for image understanding

Chroma Vector Store ‚Äì for document retrieval

PIL (Pillow) ‚Äì for image handling

dotenv ‚Äì for environment variable management

</pre>


<h2><b>Usage</b></h2>
1. In the input field, enter your medical condition (for example, "I have diabetes").
2. Upload a picture of your food, drink, or fruit.
3. Click to proceed.
4. After analyzing the image, the system will provide detailed reasoning and advice on whether the item is appropriate for your condition.


<h2><b>Input</b></h2>
Health condition: ‚ÄúI have high blood pressure.‚Äù

Uploaded image: Banana


<h2><b>Output</b></h2>
People with high blood pressure can usually safely eat bananas. <br>
It has potassium, which aids in blood pressure regulation.  <br>
To maintain balanced sugar levels, portion control is recommended.
